# Notes

- selection with widget
- widget inserted -> becomes selection
- some sort of get bounding rect / bbox to get coords and dimensions
- figma.group index has to be explicitly provided as undefined (not happening any more?)
- semi confiusing: color consistency. fill stroke opacity or alpha of rgba?
- handling undo.
  - if i add to canvas, track new nodes in widget, and undo node addition,
  - my stored node ids will no longer map to actual nodes.
